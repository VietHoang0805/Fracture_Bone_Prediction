# Fracture_Bone_Prediction

This repository contains a computer vision project implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook and Streamlit for deployment. The goal of this project is to analyze and process images from fracture bone datasets to achieve a specific object detection task

```

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements

Make sure to install the required libraries before running the project:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Optional: Create Virutal Environment

> In the directory containing the project, run the following command to create the virtual environment `venv`:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

> After creating the virtual environment, activate it with the command

```bash
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

> You can also disable venv if needed with the command

```bash
deactivate
```

### :rocket: How to run

1. Clone the repository:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/VietHoang0805/Fracture_Bone_Prediction.git
cd Fracture_Bone_Prediction
```

2. Run the notebook:

Open [ComputerVision.ipynb](ComputerVision.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

You can see input image

3. Launch the Streamlit app:
``` bash
streamlit run Streamlit/app.py
```
After run [app.py](Streamlit/app.py "Streamlit") you can see UI below
